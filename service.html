                                        <a href = https://www.jpmorganchase.com/impact/people/mentoring-skilled-volunteerism/the-service-corps >During my summer internship at J.P Morgan Chase</a>, I was provided with the oppurtunity to uncap some markers, fold some papers and send nice letters 
                                        to kids in hospitals across the globe. This was a very touching oppurtunity for me, and I was very happy to hopefully have put smiles on the faces of some of these kids.

                                    <p>
                                        As a first and second year student at Texas A&M, I was eager to join clubs that wanted to serve the community and the environment and the Eco-Reps provided this. 
                                        I was able to volunteer at Campus Clean-Ups, where we walked around campus and picked up trash and litter that was left behind. I also volunteered at Swap Shop events, where 
                                        people can donate their old clothes and other items in exchange for the clothes and items donated by others. On top of this, I attended the 2022 Big Event with this organization. 
                                        My sophomore year, I was elected as the Webmaster and revamped the website as well as their <a href =https://instagram.com/aggieecoreps >social media presence</a>.

                                    <p>
                                        While a student in high school, I was able to <a href = https://parkercountydemocrats.org> volunteer</a> at the polls during the 2020 general election and the 2020 primaries. 
                                        As a volunteer, I helped voters check in, use the voting machines and submit their ballots. While both of these elections gained notoriety
                                        for the tense political climate, I found that the people voting were all very kind and respectful to the volunteers and each other.

                                    <p>
                                        Ever since I was a kid I helped my grandma with yard work and house maintenance with the guidance of my older brother.
                                        This work showed me the value of hard work and the importance of helping others and my family. While this is not a formal volunteer oppurtunity, I believe it is worth including here to encourage others to help others and their family members in need.
