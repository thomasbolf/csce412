                                <p>
                                    I am currently working on a project that involves compiling quality of life metrics for cities in the United States
                                    and data from dog shelters from the <a href="https://www.petfinder.com/developers/">Petfinder Public API</a>. Many dog shelters across the United States advertise their 
                                    dogs on Petfinder for interested adopters for a small fee, and I am interested in the relationship between <a href="https://goteleport.com/docs/api/introduction/"> quality of life metrics</a> (such as C02 emissions, financial information, etc.) and 
                                    the types and number of dogs in shelters. Overall there are a million different ways to analyze all of the different dimensions of data from both of these sources, and I am 
                                    excited to be able to compile this information.

                        <p>
                            Over the summer of 2023, I worked  on a project that involved web scraping <a href="https://urbandictionary.com">Urban Dictionary</a> for different groups of objects to determine 
                            the sentiment value of their definitions. I used the Python library <a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">BeautifulSoup</a> to scrape the website and the <a href="https://www.nltk.org">Natural Language Toolkit (nltk)</a> to determine the sentiment value of the definitions.
                            I found a few major variations in populations of words, with the most clear one being that for some reason, a man's name is significantly more likely to have a negative sentiment than a females name. Additionally, the sentiment value of words vary heavily based on which language is being spoken.

                                <p>
                                A famous case study in psychology is the synchronization of heart rate between a mother and her child whenever she is caring for them.
                                The logic of this phenomena has been extended to research such that any team work can be measured by heart-rate synchrony. Last year, I worked in the Texas A&M 
                                Neuroergonomics lab to measure synchrony in a human-robot team as opposed to an all human team. This involved taking the ECG of participants during the expirement (a measure of their heart rate) and using
                                mathematical models in python and R to analyze the synchrony between teams. The findings of this research can be found in <a href = https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21695067231194337?icid=int.sj-abstract.similar-articles.5> this paper</a>.
